# API Key Security Improvements Summary

## Changes Made on May 27, 2025

### 1. Moved DeepSeek API Key to Environment Variables

**Files Changed:**
- `c:\Users\rasha\Desktop\test erp\backend\.env` - Added API key to environment variables
- `c:\Users\rasha\Desktop\test erp\backend\routes\deepseekRoutes.js` - Updated to use environment variable

**Before:**
```javascript
const DEEPSEEK_API_KEY = 'sk-3d324dd1c6b64ec7b1b5f9fe7c77b05b';
```

**After:**
```javascript
const DEEPSEEK_API_KEY = process.env.DEEPSEEK_API_KEY;
```

### 2. Updated Documentation

**Files Changed:**
- `c:\Users\rasha\Desktop\test erp\docs\unspsc-ai-search.md` - Updated security considerations
- `c:\Users\rasha\Desktop\test erp\INSTALLATION-INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Added instructions for DeepSeek API setup
- `c:\Users\rasha\Desktop\test erp\docs\api-key-security.md` - Created new document with security best practices

### 3. Additional Security Checks

- Performed a search for any other hardcoded API keys or sensitive credentials
- Confirmed that all API keys are now stored in environment variables

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Improved Security**
   - API keys are no longer stored in source code
   - Reduced risk of accidental exposure in version control
   - Easier to rotate keys without changing code

2. **Better Development Practices**
   - Follows industry best practices for credential management
   - Makes local development setup more consistent
   - Simplifies key rotation process

3. **Enhanced Documentation**
   - Clear instructions for setting up API keys
   - Security best practices documented for the team
   - Improved onboarding experience for new developers

## Next Steps

1. **Consider implementing a secure secrets management solution** for more advanced protection
2. **Set up automated security scanning** to detect any accidentally committed credentials
3. **Create a key rotation schedule** to regularly update API keys
