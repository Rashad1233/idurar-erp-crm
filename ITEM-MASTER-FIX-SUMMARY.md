# ERP Item Master Enhancement Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Temporary Code Generation**
- ✅ **FIXED**: Temporary codes are now generated only when the item is saved (in `createItemMaster`), not while the user is typing
- ✅ **FIXED**: Temporary number format: `TEMP-YYYYMMDD-XXX` (e.g., `TEMP-20250620-001`)
- ✅ **FIXED**: Sequential numbering for same-day items

### 2. **AI Menu Application Process**
- ✅ **FIXED**: AI generation now creates suggestions instead of auto-applying
- ✅ **FIXED**: User must explicitly click individual suggestions or "Apply All" to use AI data
- ✅ **FIXED**: AI suggestions are displayed in a dedicated menu card with clear buttons
- ✅ **FIXED**: No automatic application while typing - AI only runs on button click

### 3. **Technical Description Field**
- ✅ **FIXED**: Added `technicalDescription` field to the database model
- ✅ **FIXED**: Added technical description to the frontend form (separate from long description)
- ✅ **FIXED**: AI generates technical specifications separately from business descriptions
- ✅ **FIXED**: Users can manually edit technical descriptions or use AI suggestions

### 4. **Review Process and Stock Codes**
- ✅ **FIXED**: Added complete review/approval workflow
- ✅ **FIXED**: Stock code logic (ST1, ST2, NS3) is applied during approval, not creation
- ✅ **FIXED**: Final item numbers are generated only after approval
- ✅ **FIXED**: Items start in DRAFT status and require review

## Updated Files

### Frontend Changes
- `frontend/src/pages/ItemMaster/ItemMasterCreate.jsx`:
  - Removed auto-generation while typing
  - Added AI suggestions menu with individual apply buttons
  - Added technical description field
  - Fixed state management (removed `aiGenerated`, added `aiSuggestions`, `showAiMenu`)

### Backend Changes
- `backend/controllers/aiController.js`:
  - Updated AI prompt to include separate `technicalDescription` field
  - Enhanced AI generation to create suggestions not auto-apply

- `backend/controllers/itemMasterController.js`:
  - Added `technicalDescription` to item creation
  - Fixed temporary number generation (only on save)
  - Added `reviewItemMaster()` function for approval workflow
  - Added `getItemsPendingReview()` function
  - Implemented proper stock code logic during approval

- `backend/models/sequelize/ItemMaster.js`:
  - Added `technicalDescription` field
  - Added review workflow fields (`reviewComments`, `reviewedAt`, `approvedAt`)
  - Updated stock code hooks for business rules

- `backend/routes/itemRoutes.js`:
  - Added review workflow routes

## Business Rules Implemented

### Stock Code Logic
- **ST1**: Stock item but no planned levels (Planned Stock = N, Stock Item = Y)
- **ST2**: Planned stock with min/max levels (Planned Stock = Y)
- **NS3**: Non-stock items for contracts/direct orders (Stock Item = N)

### Workflow Process
1. **DRAFT**: New items created by users (with temporary numbers)
2. **PENDING_REVIEW**: Items submitted for review
3. **APPROVED**: Items approved with final numbers and stock codes
4. **REJECTED**: Items rejected with comments

### Item Number Generation
- **Temporary**: `TEMP-YYYYMMDD-XXX` (during creation/draft)
- **Final**: `[Category][SubCategory]XXXXXX` (after approval)

## API Endpoints

### New Review Endpoints
- `PUT /api/item/:id/review` - Approve or reject an item
- `GET /api/item/pending-review` - Get items needing review

### Enhanced AI Endpoint
- `POST /api/ai/generate-complete-item` - Generate AI suggestions (not auto-apply)

## User Experience Improvements

### AI Generation
- Users must click "Generate AI" button to get suggestions
- AI suggestions appear in a dedicated menu
- Users can apply individual suggestions or all at once
- No automatic changes while typing

### Technical Data
- Separate technical description field for engineering details
- Can be filled manually or via AI suggestions
- Stored properly in database for retrieval

### Review Workflow
- Clear status progression: DRAFT → PENDING_REVIEW → APPROVED/REJECTED
- Proper business rules enforcement at approval stage
- Final item numbers only assigned after approval

## Next Steps for Testing
1. Test AI suggestion menu (generate but don't auto-apply)
2. Test technical description field (manual entry and AI)
3. Test temporary number generation (only on save)
4. Test review workflow (draft → approval → final number)
5. Test stock code assignment during approval process
