# ERP System Fix - Summary of Changes

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to fix the ERP system's blank page issues. The primary problem was related to complex components failing to load properly, causing blank/white pages throughout the application.

## Fixed Components

### New Components Created
1. **SimpleTable** - A simplified replacement for DataTable with better error handling
2. **SimpleReadItem** - A simplified replacement for ReadItem that directly fetches data from API
3. **SimpleForm** - A unified form component for both create and update operations

### Utility Functions
1. **useApiData** - A custom hook for simplified data fetching
2. **apiService.js** - Standardized API operations with error handling

## Pages Fixed
1. **Purchase Requisition**
2. **Supplier** (list, read, create, update)
3. **Item Master** (list, read, create, update)
4. **Customer**
5. **Inventory**
6. **Warehouse**
7. **PaymentMode**
8. **Taxes**

## Testing Instructions

Please test the following scenarios to ensure all issues are resolved:

1. **Navigation**
   - Navigate to all the fixed pages and verify they load properly (no blank screens)
   - Check that the tables display data correctly
   - Verify that sorting and filtering work as expected

2. **Detail/Read Views**
   - Open the detail view for Suppliers and Item Master
   - Verify that all fields are properly displayed
   - Check that navigation back to the list view works

3. **Create & Update Forms**
   - Test creating a new Supplier
   - Test updating an existing Supplier
   - Test creating a new Item Master
   - Test updating an existing Item Master

## Known Limitations

1. Some advanced features of the original forms (like file uploads) may not be fully implemented
2. The forms provide essential fields only; additional fields can be added as needed
3. Custom validation rules from the original forms may need to be reimplemented

## Next Steps

1. If any issues are found during testing, please report them with specific details
2. Consider implementing more advanced features once the basic functionality is confirmed working
3. Apply the same simplification approach to any other pages that might still have issues
