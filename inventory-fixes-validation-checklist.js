/**
 * Manual validation checklist for EnhancedInventoryForm fixes
 * 
 * âœ… COMPLETED FIXES:
 * 
 * 1. API Cache Clear Method:
 *    - Added clear(key) method to apiRequestCache object
 *    - Method properly deletes both data[key] and requests[key]
 * 
 * 2. UNSPSC Code Fix:
 *    - Added setTimeout with 100ms delay in handleItemMasterChange
 *    - Force updates form with setFieldsValue after timeout
 *    - Ensures UNSPSC code is properly copied from item master
 * 
 * 3. Bin Locations Fix:
 *    - Modified handleStorageLocationChange to force fresh data
 *    - Added apiRequestCache.clear(binLocationsCacheKey) call
 *    - Enhanced debugging with raw response logging
 *    - Added sample bin location logging when data is available
 * 
 * 4. Debugging Enhancements:
 *    - Added useEffect to monitor bin locations state changes
 *    - Logs number of bin locations and storage location
 *    - Shows sample bin location when available
 *    - Warns when no bin locations found
 * 
 * 5. Return Statements:
 *    - All handler functions have proper "if (!isMounted.current) return;" checks
 *    - Prevents memory leaks and stale state updates
 * 
 * ðŸŽ¯ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIXES:
 * 
 * 1. UNSPSC Code Issue:
 *    - When selecting an item master, UNSPSC code should appear in the form field
 *    - The code should persist and not disappear
 *    - UNSPSC description should load automatically
 * 
 * 2. Bin Locations Issue:
 *    - When selecting a storage location, bin locations should load fresh each time
 *    - No stale cached data should interfere
 *    - Console should show detailed debugging information
 *    - Bin locations dropdown should populate with available options
 * 
 * ðŸ§ª TO TEST THE FIXES:
 * 
 * 1. Open the inventory form
 * 2. Select an item master and verify UNSPSC code appears and stays
 * 3. Select a storage location and check console for debug logs
 * 4. Verify bin locations dropdown populates
 * 5. Try changing storage locations multiple times to test cache clearing
 * 
 * All fixes have been successfully implemented and should resolve both issues.
