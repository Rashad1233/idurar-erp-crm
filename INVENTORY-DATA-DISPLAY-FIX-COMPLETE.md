# Inventory Data Display Fix

## Issue Summary
The inventory items table was not displaying all columns correctly. Important fields like storage location, bin location, item numbers, and UNSPSC codes were showing as null or empty, even though the data was being retrieved from the backend.

## Root Causes
1. **Missing Join Tables**: The SQL query in the backend was not joining with the StorageLocations and BinLocations tables
2. **Missing Fields**: The returned data didn't include storage location and bin location information
3. **Inconsistent Data Format**: No consistent structure for displaying location information
4. **Missing Calculations**: Line price (quantity Ã— unit price) was not being calculated
5. **ItemMaster Data Not Structured**: ItemMaster data was not properly structured for frontend rendering
6. **UNSPSC Codes Not Included**: UNSPSC codes were missing in the returned data

## Solutions Implemented

### Backend Fixes
1. **Enhanced Inventory Routes**:
   - Added JOIN clauses to connect with StorageLocations and BinLocations tables
   - Added fields for storage location code/description and bin location code/description
   - Created formatted storageLocation and binLocation objects in the response
   - Added line price calculation
   - Added proper ItemMaster data including UNSPSC codes
   - Structured the data with nested objects for better frontend rendering

2. **Data Formatting**:
   - Ensured consistent data format for all inventory items
   - Added fallbacks for missing location data
   - Structured objects consistently for frontend rendering
   - Created proper ItemMaster objects with all necessary fields
   - Properly formatted UNSPSC codes as objects with code and title

### How It Works
The updated backend query now:
1. Joins the Inventories table with ItemMasters, StorageLocations, and BinLocations
2. Retrieves codes and descriptions from all related tables
3. Formats the data into structured objects with proper fallbacks
4. Calculates derived values like line price
5. Properly structures ItemMaster data with UNSPSC codes
6. Ensures all columns have data for display

## How to Verify the Fix
1. Restart the backend server to apply the changes
2. Open the Inventory page in the frontend
3. Check that storage locations and bin locations now display properly
4. Check that item numbers and UNSPSC codes are displayed correctly
5. Check that line prices are calculated correctly
6. Alternatively, run the `verify-inventory-fixes.js` or `verify-inventory-itemmaster-fixes.js` script to check the API responses

## Additional Recommendations
1. **Database Structure**: Consider adding foreign key constraints between Inventories and location tables
2. **Default Values**: Set appropriate default values in the database for fields that should never be null
3. **Data Validation**: Add more robust validation when creating/updating inventory items
4. **Documentation**: Update API documentation to reflect the expected data formats

This fix ensures that all inventory data is displayed correctly in the frontend, even when some fields are empty or missing.
