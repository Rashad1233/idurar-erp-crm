# RFQ Status Enum Fix Summary

## Issue
The RFQ approval process was failing with the error:
```
SequelizeDatabaseError: invalid input value for enum "enum_RequestForQuotations_status": "approved_by_supplier"
```

## Root Cause
The RequestForQuotation model in the code had the status enum value 'approved_by_supplier' defined, but this value was not present in the database enum type.

## Solution Applied

1. **Created a migration script** (`backend/fix-rfq-status-enum.js`) that:
   - Checks if the 'approved_by_supplier' value already exists in the enum
   - If not, adds it to the enum using PostgreSQL's ALTER TYPE command
   - Verifies the update by listing all enum values

2. **Created a PowerShell wrapper** (`backend/fix-rfq-status-enum.ps1`) to execute the Node.js script properly in Windows environment

3. **Successfully executed the migration**, which added the missing enum value to the database

## Result
The database enum now includes all the values defined in the model:
- draft
- sent
- in_progress
- completed
- cancelled
- approved_by_supplier âœ… (newly added)

## Files Created/Modified
- `backend/fix-rfq-status-enum.js` - Main migration script
- `backend/fix-rfq-status-enum.ps1` - PowerShell execution wrapper
- `backend/check-rfq-enum.js` - Utility to check current enum values

## Next Steps
The RFQ supplier approval functionality should now work correctly. The backend server may need to be restarted to ensure all connections are using the updated schema.

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always create database migrations when adding new enum values to models
2. Keep model definitions in sync with database schema
3. Test enum changes in development before deploying to production
