# Warehouse Data Display Fix

## Problem
The warehouse page was loading without errors but the data wasn't displaying correctly:
- The storage locations table showed blank/null values for Name and Address fields
- The bin locations table showed blank/null values for Storage Location and Description

## Root Cause
The column definitions in the frontend didn't match the actual data structure returned by the API:

### Actual Data Structure for Storage Locations:
```json
{
  "id": "d88eb55f-1301-4d17-9d50-1425f9cb0be6",
  "code": "WH01",
  "description": "Main Warehouse",
  "street": "",
  "city": "",
  "postalCode": "",
  "country": "",
  "isActive": true,
  "createdById": "...",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "updatedAt": "...",
  "createdByName": "System Administrator"
}
```

### Actual Data Structure for Bin Locations:
```json
{
  "id": "19b42105-b831-498c-b047-ae0bcacc3df3",
  "binCode": "B01",
  "description": "zssdd",
  "isActive": true,
  "storageLocationId": "d88eb55f-1301-4d17-9d50-1425f9cb0be6",
  "createdById": "...",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "updatedAt": "...",
  "storageLocationCode": "WH01",
  "storageLocationDescription": "Main Warehouse"
}
```

## Solution

1. Updated the column definitions in the Warehouse component to match the actual data structure:
   - Changed 'name' to 'description' for storage locations
   - Added a custom render function for the address field to combine street, city, and country
   - Changed 'storageLocation' to 'storageLocationCode' for bin locations
   - Added a custom render to show both code and description for storage locations in the bin table

2. Updated the search configuration to use the correct fields:
   - Changed searchFields from 'code,name' to 'code,description'
   - Changed outputValue from '_id' to 'id'

3. Enhanced the link rendering in SimpleCrudModule to properly handle the warehouse entities
   - Added special case handling for warehouse routes
   - Added error handling to prevent crashes

## Result

- The warehouse page now displays data correctly in all columns
- Storage locations show proper description and address information
- Bin locations show proper storage location code and description
- Links and actions work correctly for both entity types

## Next Steps

1. Continue to standardize the data model across the application
2. Consider updating database models to ensure consistent field naming
3. Add data validation on both frontend and backend
