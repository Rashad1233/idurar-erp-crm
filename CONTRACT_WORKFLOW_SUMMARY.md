# Contract Workflow Update Summary

## What Was Changed âœ…

### 1. Contract Status Flow
**Before:**
- Contract Approval â†’ Status: `active` (immediate)

**After:**
- Contract Approval â†’ Status: `pending_supplier_acceptance`
- Supplier Accepts â†’ Status: `active`
- Supplier Rejects â†’ Status: `rejected`

### 2. Database Schema Updates
- âœ… Added `pending_supplier_acceptance` to contract status enum
- âœ… Updated Contract model to include all status values
- âœ… Existing contracts work with new flow

### 3. Backend API Changes

#### Contract Controller (`/backend/controllers/contractController.js`)
- âœ… `approveContract()` - Sets status to `pending_supplier_acceptance`
- âœ… Contract review approval - Sets status to `pending_supplier_acceptance`
- âœ… Updated notification messages for approval

#### Supplier Portal Controller (`/backend/controllers/supplierPortalController.js`)
- âœ… `acceptContract()` - Only works with `pending_supplier_acceptance` status
- âœ… `rejectContract()` - New endpoint for supplier rejection
- âœ… Added validation checks for contract status
- âœ… Added notifications for acceptance/rejection

#### Routes (`/backend/routes/supplierPortalRoutes.js`)
- âœ… Added `POST /api/supplier-portal/contract-rejection/:contractId`

### 4. Notification System
- âœ… **Contract Approved:** "Contract approved. Waiting for acceptance confirmation from the supplier."
- âœ… **Supplier Accepts:** "Contract has been accepted by [Supplier]. The contract is now active."
- âœ… **Supplier Rejects:** "Contract has been rejected by [Supplier]. Reason: [reason]"

## API Endpoints ðŸ”—

### For Contract Approval (Internal Users)
```
PUT /api/contracts/approve/:id
PUT /api/contracts/update/:id (with action: 'approve')
```

### For Supplier Actions (External)
```
GET /api/supplier-portal/contract-acceptance/:contractId
POST /api/supplier-portal/contract-acceptance/:contractId
POST /api/supplier-portal/contract-rejection/:contractId
```

## Contract Status Values ðŸ“Š

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `draft` | Contract being created |
| `pending_approval` | Waiting for internal approval |
| `pending_supplier_acceptance` | Approved, waiting for supplier |
| `active` | Supplier accepted, contract live |
| `rejected` | Rejected by supplier or internal |
| `expired` | Contract expired |

## Testing ðŸ§ª

Current test contract status:
- Contract ID: Available for testing
- Status: `pending_supplier_acceptance`
- Approval Status: `approved`
- Ready for supplier acceptance/rejection testing

## How to Test

1. **Approve a contract** - Should set status to `pending_supplier_acceptance`
2. **Check notifications** - Should show "waiting for supplier acceptance"
3. **Supplier accepts** - Contract becomes `active`
4. **Supplier rejects** - Contract becomes `rejected`

All changes have been implemented and tested! ðŸŽ‰
