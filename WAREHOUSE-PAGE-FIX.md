# Warehouse Page Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. Fixed reference to undefined 'props' variable in SimpleCrudModule component
   - Changed `props.originalEntity` to `originalEntity` (already available from destructured props)

2. Added better handling of data and error states in SimpleTable component

3. Improved the warehouseService module to better handle API responses and route fallbacks

## Next Steps

1. Test the warehouse page at http://localhost:3000/warehouse 
2. Verify both storage locations and bin locations are loading correctly
3. Check the action buttons (View, Edit, Delete) work properly

## How to Test

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/warehouse
2. Check that storage locations appear in the table
3. Switch to the "Bins" tab and verify bin locations load
4. Try clicking on a storage location code to view details
5. Try the edit and delete actions
