## Inventory Creation Error Fix Summary

### Problem
The server was returning error: `column "item_number" does not exist` when creating new inventory items.

### Root Cause
1. **Column Naming Mismatch**: The database tables had both camelCase (e.g., `itemNumber`) and snake_case (e.g., `item_number`) column expectations, but some columns were missing.

2. **Table Name Mismatch**: Some SQL queries were using lowercase table names (`inventory`) when the actual tables were uppercase (`Inventories`).

3. **Model Field Mapping Issues**: Sequelize models had field mappings expecting snake_case columns that didn't exist in the database.

### Solutions Applied

#### 1. Added Missing Columns to ItemMasters Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE "ItemMasters" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "item_number" VARCHAR;
ALTER TABLE "ItemMasters" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "description" TEXT;
-- ... and other missing snake_case columns
```

#### 2. Copied Data from CamelCase to Snake_Case Columns
```sql
UPDATE "ItemMasters" SET "item_number" = "itemNumber" WHERE "item_number" IS NULL;
UPDATE "ItemMasters" SET "short_description" = "shortDescription" WHERE "short_description" IS NULL;
-- ... and other data copying
```

#### 3. Added Compatibility Column to Inventories Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE "Inventories" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "itemId" UUID;
UPDATE "Inventories" SET "itemId" = "itemMasterId" WHERE "itemId" IS NULL;
```

#### 4. Fixed SQL Queries in Backend Routes
- Fixed `directInventoryRoutes.js` to use `"Inventories"` instead of `"inventory"`
- Fixed `fixedDirectInventoryRoutes.js` to use `"ItemMasters"` instead of `"item_master"`
- Updated column names in queries to use existing fields like `"itemNumber"` and `"shortDescription"`
- Fixed join conditions to use `i."itemMasterId" = im.id`

#### 5. Fixed ItemMaster Model Configuration
- Removed incorrect field mappings
- Set correct table name to `"ItemMasters"`
- Removed `underscored: true` option

### Result
✅ The `column "item_number" does not exist` error is now resolved
✅ Inventory creation should work from the frontend
✅ Both camelCase and snake_case column access is supported for compatibility
✅ All SQL queries use correct table and column names

### Test Status
- ✅ ItemMaster.findByPk() now works correctly
- ✅ Raw SQL queries to both tables work
- ✅ Column mappings are compatible with both naming conventions

The frontend inventory creation should now work without the server error.
